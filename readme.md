## __Project Description__

Goal: Make a Tic-Tac-Toe console application in any programming language I desire.

This project is designed to demonstrate the implementation of Tic-Tac-Toe as a console-based game in Clojure, with features such as player vs. computer gameplay, move validation, and statistics tracking.

### __MVP Goals__
  
The minimum viable product (MVP) for this project includes the following features:
-Take a users name as input, and hold it in state throughout all the games that a player decides to continue playing.
-Basic move validation: Ensure that players can only place their marks in unoccupied spaces. Player entry may only be integers between 0 and 2. [0 1 2]
-Win condition checks: The game ends when either player wins or when the board is full (draw). In this case the computer has been optimized to win or draw every game.
-Simple text-based interface: The game board and current game status are displayed in the console.
-Game replay option: After each game, players can choose to play again. Statistics for the matches are saved in local storage and the user is provided a running tally of their current statistics.

### __Stretch Goals__

-‚úÖ Game Replay Option: Implement replay functionality where after each game, players can choose to play again.
-üèÜ Statistics Recap: After each game basic game statistics including the number
and percentage of games won/lost/drawn will be displayed to the user. These scores
will be stored locally for the time being, with DB storage an optional future goal.
-üìä Game Logging: Implement logging to track moves and decisions during gameplay for future analysis.
-üåç Database Integration: Save player statistics to a cloud or local database (e.g., SQL, CSV, or JSON/EDN).
-üåê SPA (Single Page Application): Move from a console app to a more interactive experience using a popular web library such as "Helix" (ClojureScript).
  
### __Installation__

1. Ensure you have Clojure installed on your machine. You can follow the official installation guide.
2. Clone this repository to your local machine:
3. git clone https://github.com/your-username/tic-tac-toe.git
4. cd tic-tac-toe
5. Run the game using:
¬† ¬† -clojure -m tic-tac-toe.core
¬† ¬† -This will start the Tic-Tac-Toe game in your terminal.

### __How to Play__

1. Start the Game: Run the application in your console.
2. Input Moves: When it's your turn, input the row and column numbers (0, 1, or 2) where you want to place your mark.
3. Game Progression: The game will continue until one player wins or the game is a draw.
    -(Tip: Only the computer can win)
4. Replay: After each game, you will be asked if you want to play again. Type "yes" to play another round or "no" to exit the game.

### __Technologies Used__

-Clojure: The programming language used to build this application. Clojure is a functional, general-purpose language that runs on the Java Virtual Machine (JVM).
-Console: The game runs in the terminal/console and displays the game state using text output.
-Minimax algorithm (for AI opponent): A decision-making algorithm used to evaluate the best possible move for the AI.
-Clojure.Test: I used the core clojure testing library to include some basic test cases for all of my functions.
-Calva/WSL/VS Code: My actual coding setup and helpful packages.
-Git,flowstorm debugger: supporting technologies! Helping me to host this and also ensure it is working correctly respectively.

#### __Other Potential Future Improvements__

-Multiplayer: Extend the game to support network play where players can play from different machines.
-Multidimensionality: Level the game up by doing cubes or other geometric figures.
